        <h1>Welcome to My Way Of Physics</h1>

        <p>
            Here, I have included what I have learned in Physics on my own and even some recommendations of books and sources!
        </p>
         <a href="notes.html">Go to Notes</a><h2>Who Am I?</h2>
         <p>I'm just a physics enthusiast currently in 1st year of high school in Jammu,India. I am currently studying in GD GOENKA PUBLIC SCHOOL JAMMU I am just here to help other enthusiast like me to help them learn physics the right way. Some people show off maths skills in physics but c'mon.
         </p>
        <h2>Contact me</h2></h2>
        <p>Got a physics problem for me?, want advice or just want to talk to me; Just email me at:kasudag7@gmail.com </p>
        <h2>Books and Resources</h2>
        <p>I'll put my recommended here. Rememember to solve it accordingly.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Concept Of Physics 1,2 By H.C Verma</b>: A great conceptual but rather easy book, but best for starters</li>
            <li> <b>Resnick Halliday</b>( Idk which one as I have not solved this one personally but I hear it's a great book)</li>
            <li><b>Problems In General Physics By I.E Irodov</b>: is a great book and the collection of problems is great but not all problems are releveant so do your research before solving.</li>
            <li><b>Pathfinder for Olympiad and JEE (Advanced) Physics</b>: This book is peak, and I MEAN PEAKKKK. It is my favourite book and contains mind boggling and counter intuitive problems.This is a must buy for any physics enthusiast.</li>
        </ul>
        Of course the list doesn't end here but these are the only books I solve but I solve them honestly. There are many more books by authors such as David Morin. <h3>Some online teachers are</h3> 
        <ul><li>><a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200" target="_blank">Prof. Shankar's Physics Course (Yale)</a>. Prof. Shankar is a great teacher and also has a great humor.</li>
         <li><a href="https://youtu.be/wWnfJ0-xXRE?si=Pj6rrBL-jiRdSZvi" target="_blank">Prof. Walter Lewin's Couse (MIT)</a> Cool demonstrations</li>   
</ul>
